# Ubichain Playground

This folder contains example code and experiments demonstrating the usage of ubichain library features. It's perfect for understanding how to integrate the library into your own projects or to explore new features before they're fully documented.

## Contents

- `bip32-demo.ts` - Demonstrates BIP32 hierarchical deterministic wallet functionality
- Additional examples will be added as new features are implemented

## Running Examples

```bash
# For BIP32 demo
npx tsx playground/bip32-demo.ts
```

## Notes

- Examples in this folder are for demonstration purposes only and may not include all security best practices
- For production use, refer to the main library documentation and tests
- Feel free to modify and experiment with these examples to better understand the library's capabilities
