# Generating Wallets

> Learn how to create complete cryptocurrency wallets with private keys, public keys, and addresses.

## What is a Wallet?

In the context of ubichain, a "wallet" combines a key pair (private and public keys) with a blockchain address. This provides a complete solution for interacting with a blockchain.

The `Wallet` interface extends the `KeyPair` interface:

```typescript
interface Wallet extends KeyPair {
  address: string;
}
```

Each wallet contains:
- A private key for signing transactions
- A public key derived from the private key
- A blockchain address derived from the public key

## Generating a Wallet

Ubichain provides a convenient way to generate a complete wallet in one step:

```js
import { useBlockchain } from 'ubichain';
import bitcoin from 'ubichain/blockchains/bitcoin';

const chain = useBlockchain(bitcoin());
const wallet = chain.generateWallet();

console.log('Private Key:', wallet.keys.private);
console.log('Public Key:', wallet.keys.public);
console.log('Address:', wallet.address);
```

This generates all three components in one go, making it easy to create a new wallet for any supported blockchain.

## Wallet Options

You can pass options to the `generateWallet` method to customize the wallet generation:

```js
// Generate a wallet with an uncompressed public key
const uncompressedWallet = chain.generateWallet({ compressed: false });

// Generate a Bitcoin P2SH wallet
const bitcoinChain = useBlockchain(bitcoin());
const p2shWallet = bitcoinChain.generateWallet({}, 'p2sh');
console.log('P2SH Address:', p2shWallet.address); // Starts with '3'
```

The first parameter is an options object that is passed to the key generation functions. The second parameter is the address type, which is specific to each blockchain implementation.

## Wallets for Different Blockchains

Each blockchain has its own wallet format:

### Bitcoin Wallet

```js
const bitcoinChain = useBlockchain(bitcoin());
const btcWallet = bitcoinChain.generateWallet();

console.log('Bitcoin Private Key:', btcWallet.keys.private);
console.log('Bitcoin Public Key:', btcWallet.keys.public);
console.log('Bitcoin Address:', btcWallet.address); // Starts with '1'
```

### Ethereum Wallet

```js
const ethereumChain = useBlockchain(ethereum());
const ethWallet = ethereumChain.generateWallet();

console.log('Ethereum Private Key:', ethWallet.keys.private);
console.log('Ethereum Public Key:', ethWallet.keys.public);
console.log('Ethereum Address:', ethWallet.address); // Starts with '0x'
```

### Solana Wallet

```js
const solanaChain = useBlockchain(solana());
const solWallet = solanaChain.generateWallet();

console.log('Solana Private Key:', solWallet.keys.private);
console.log('Solana Public Key:', solWallet.keys.public);
console.log('Solana Address:', solWallet.address);
```

## Using Generated Wallets

Once you have generated a wallet, you can use it for various blockchain operations:

- The private key can be used for signing transactions
- The public key can be used for verification
- The address can be used for receiving funds

While ubichain currently focuses on key and address generation, future versions may include transaction creation and signing functionality.

## Importing Existing Keys

If you already have a private key, you can create a wallet from it:

```js
const privateKey = '7f9e5b9e3bbed34a4c28c8c1665525fc2cd7afb4fdc7edca3eb93ddf8a31ef56';

// Generate the public key
const publicKey = chain.getKeyPublic(privateKey);

// Generate the address
const address = chain.getAddress(publicKey);

// Create a wallet object manually
const wallet = {
  keys: {
    private: privateKey,
    public: publicKey
  },
  address
};

console.log('Imported Wallet:', wallet);
```

## Security Considerations

When working with cryptocurrency wallets, always consider security best practices:

1. Never share your private keys with anyone
2. Store private keys securely, preferably in an encrypted format
3. Consider using hardware wallets for substantial amounts
4. Use a proper key derivation path for production wallets (BIP32/BIP39/BIP44)
5. Be cautious when generating keys in a browser environment

::warning
Ubichain is primarily a tool for interacting with blockchain protocols. It does not currently implement secure key storage or HD wallet functionality. For production applications, consider using additional security measures.

## Implementation Details

The wallet generation functionality is implemented in the `blockchain.ts` file, with the following structure:

```js
function generateWallet(options?, addressType?) {
  const keyPair = generateKeys(options);
  const address = blockchain.getAddress(keyPair.keys.public, addressType);
  
  return {
    ...keyPair,
    address
  };
}
```

This simple but powerful abstraction makes it easy to generate consistent wallets across different blockchain platforms.
