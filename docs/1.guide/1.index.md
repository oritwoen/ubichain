# Getting Started

> Learn how to set up and use ubichain in your project.

## Introduction

When working with blockchain applications, developers often need to generate keys, derive addresses, and manage wallets across multiple blockchain platforms. Each blockchain has its own cryptographic standards, address formats, and validation rules, making it challenging to support multiple blockchains in a single application.

Ubichain provides a universal interface for interacting with different blockchains, allowing you to generate keys, derive addresses, and create wallets with a consistent API across all supported blockchains.

## Installation

Install [`ubichain`](https://npmjs.com/package/ubichain) npm package:

:pm-install{name="ubichain"}

## Basic Usage

```js [my-wallet.js]
import { useBlockchain, blockchains } from 'ubichain';

// Using lazy factories for better performance and tree-shaking
// Create blockchain interfaces with lazy loading
const bitcoinImpl = await blockchains.bitcoin()();
const ethereumImpl = await blockchains.ethereum()();

const bitcoinChain = useBlockchain(bitcoinImpl);
const ethereumChain = useBlockchain(ethereumImpl);

// Generate a complete wallet for each blockchain
const btcWallet = bitcoinChain.generateWallet();
const ethWallet = ethereumChain.generateWallet();

console.log('Bitcoin Address:', btcWallet.address);
console.log('Ethereum Address:', ethWallet.address);
```

## Supported Blockchains

Ubichain currently supports the following blockchains:

- **Bitcoin** (secp256k1)
  - Legacy addresses (P2PKH) starting with '1'
  - P2SH addresses starting with '3'
- **Ethereum** (secp256k1)
  - Standard addresses with EIP-55 checksum
- **Base** (secp256k1)
  - Same address format as Ethereum (EVM compatible)
- **Solana** (ed25519)
  - Standard addresses (Ed25519 public keys encoded in base58)
- **Aptos** (ed25519)
  - Standard addresses (Ed25519 based)
- **TRON** (secp256k1)
  - Standard addresses (Secp256k1 based with Keccak-256 hash)
- **SUI** (ed25519, secp256k1)
  - Standard addresses (Blake2b hash of scheme flag + public key)
  - Supports both Ed25519 and Secp256k1 keys

## Core Concepts

### Lazy Loading

Ubichain uses lazy loading to improve performance and reduce bundle size. Each blockchain implementation is loaded on-demand only when you need it:

```js
// The blockchain implementation is only loaded when you call this function
const bitcoinImpl = await blockchains.bitcoin()();

// You can pass options to configure the blockchain
const testnetImpl = await blockchains.bitcoin({ network: 'testnet' })();
```

### Cryptographic Curves

Ubichain supports two main cryptographic curves:

- **secp256k1**: Used by Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRON, and most other EVM-compatible blockchains
- **ed25519**: Used by Solana, Aptos, and optionally by SUI

Each blockchain implementation specifies the curve(s) it uses, and you can check this information through the `curve` property:

```js
console.log(bitcoinChain.curve);   // 'secp256k1'
console.log(solanaChain.curve);    // 'ed25519'
console.log(suiChain.curve);       // ['ed25519', 'secp256k1']
```

### Key Generation

Ubichain provides multiple ways to generate and work with cryptographic keys:

```js
// Generate a private key
const privateKey = bitcoinChain.generateKeyPrivate();

// Generate a public key from a private key
const publicKey = bitcoinChain.getKeyPublic(privateKey);

// Generate a key pair (private and public keys) in one step
const keys = bitcoinChain.generateKeys();
```

### Address Generation

Once you have a public key, you can generate a blockchain address:

```js
// Generate an address from a public key
const address = bitcoinChain.getAddress(publicKey);

// Some blockchains support multiple address formats
const p2shAddress = bitcoinChain.getAddress(publicKey, 'p2sh');
```

### Wallet Generation

For convenience, you can generate a complete wallet (private key, public key, and address) in one step:

```js
const wallet = bitcoinChain.generateWallet();
console.log('Private Key:', wallet.keys.private);
console.log('Public Key:', wallet.keys.public);
console.log('Address:', wallet.address);
```

### Address Validation

Ubichain also provides address validation functionality:

```js
// Validate an address
if (bitcoinChain.validateAddress?.('1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa')) {
  console.log('Address is valid');
}
```
