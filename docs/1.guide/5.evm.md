# Working with EVM Chains

> Learn how to work with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.

## What are EVM Chains?

EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains are blockchains that are compatible with the Ethereum execution environment. These include Ethereum itself and many other blockchains like Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and more.

In ubichain, all EVM chains share a common implementation for key generation, address derivation, and address validation.

## Supported EVM Chains

Ubichain currently supports the following EVM chains:

- **Ethereum**: The original EVM blockchain
- **Base**: An Ethereum L2 scaling solution

More EVM chains will be added in future releases.

## Common EVM Implementation

All EVM chains in ubichain use the same underlying implementation, provided by the `utils/evm.ts` module. This ensures consistent behavior across all EVM chains.

Creating a new EVM blockchain implementation is as simple as:

```js
import { createEVMBlockchain } from '../utils/evm';

export default function ethereum() {
  return createEVMBlockchain("ethereum");
}
```

## Working with EVM Addresses

### Address Format

All EVM chains use the same address format:
- Hex encoded addresses starting with '0x'
- 42 characters long (2 for '0x' prefix + 40 hex characters)
- Case-sensitive with EIP-55 checksum support

### EIP-55 Checksum

Addresses on EVM chains follow the EIP-55 standard, which uses mixed-case characters to encode checksum information:

```js
// Lowercase address (valid but doesn't include checksum)
const lowercaseAddress = '0x7e5f4552091a69125d5dfcb7b8c2659029395bdf';

// EIP-55 checksummed address (same address with checksum)
const checksumAddress = '0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf';
```

Ubichain automatically generates addresses with EIP-55 checksums and can validate addresses with or without checksums.

## Same Keys, Same Addresses

An important property of EVM chains is that the same private key will generate the same address on all EVM chains:

```js
import { useBlockchain } from 'ubichain';
import ethereum from 'ubichain/blockchains/ethereum';
import base from 'ubichain/blockchains/base';

// Create blockchain interfaces
const ethereumChain = useBlockchain(ethereum());
const baseChain = useBlockchain(base());

// Generate a private key
const privateKey = ethereumChain.generateKeyPrivate();

// Generate the same address on both chains
const ethAddress = ethereumChain.getAddress(
  ethereumChain.getKeyPublic(privateKey)
);

const baseAddress = baseChain.getAddress(
  baseChain.getKeyPublic(privateKey)
);

console.log('Same address?', ethAddress === baseAddress); // true
```

This makes it easy to use the same wallet across multiple EVM chains.

## Generating EVM Wallets

You can generate wallets for any EVM chain using the `generateWallet` method:

```js
const ethereumChain = useBlockchain(ethereum());
const ethWallet = ethereumChain.generateWallet();

console.log('Ethereum Address:', ethWallet.address);
```

All EVM wallets use the secp256k1 curve for key generation.

## Validating EVM Addresses

Ubichain provides address validation for EVM chains that checks both the format and the EIP-55 checksum:

```js
// Validate an address
const isValid = ethereumChain.validateAddress?.('0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf');

// Different case with invalid checksum
const isInvalid = ethereumChain.validateAddress?.('0x7e5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf');
```

The validation function accepts:
- Addresses with valid EIP-55 checksums
- Addresses in all lowercase (backwards compatibility)
- Addresses in all uppercase (rare, but allowed)

But it will reject addresses with mixed case that don't match the EIP-55 checksum.

## Implementation Details

The EVM implementation uses the Keccak-256 hash function for both address generation and checksum calculation:

1. **Address Generation**: 
   - Take the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key
   - Add '0x' prefix
   - Apply EIP-55 checksum

2. **EIP-55 Checksum**:
   - Compute the Keccak-256 hash of the lowercase address (without '0x' prefix)
   - For each character in the address:
     - If the corresponding hex digit in the hash is 8 or higher, make the character uppercase
     - Otherwise, make it lowercase

This standardized approach ensures compatibility with all EVM-based blockchain tools and wallets.

## Adding New EVM Chains

To add support for a new EVM chain, simply create a new file in the `blockchains` directory:

```js
// blockchains/polygon.ts
import { createEVMBlockchain } from '../utils/evm';

export default function polygon() {
  return createEVMBlockchain("polygon");
}
```

Then add it to the list of blockchains in `_blockchains.ts`:

```js
export const blockchains = Object.freeze({
  // Existing blockchains
  'polygon': 'ubichain/blockchains/polygon',
});
```

This modular approach makes it easy to extend ubichain with support for additional EVM chains.
